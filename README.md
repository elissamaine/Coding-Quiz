# Coding-Quiz

## Description 
The coding quiz was created to help coding students to prepare for the application process with this short timed quiz that asks the user basic question about coding. The quiz is 60 seconds long and five questions, with a ten second penalty for each incorrect answer. When the five questions are answered or the time runs out the quiz will end and the user will be taken to a page where they can input their initials and save their score onto local storage, and all the highscores will be displayed on the screen.
